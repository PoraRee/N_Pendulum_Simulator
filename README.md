"# N_Pendulum_Simulator" 

TODO 
1. Understand Code (OK)
2. Try to put a square in some specific place (OK, for circle) 
3. Try to handle the collision (OK)
4. Then handle the UI (such as how a user place a square)



TODO NEXT 
1. Handle the UI (such as how a user place a circle)
2. Create square (Long)
3. Add option to allow collision with environment bound (environmental constraints)
4. Add triangle (Long)

TODO NEXT+
1. Add object-object collision constraints
2. gravity (apply on collisionObj)
2. fix frontend 
3. Create square (Long)
4. Rotation constraint (opt)

TODO NEXT++ (FINISH!!) 
0. Find the up-down right-left point of a rectangle (NO NEED)
1. Add collision between pendulum and rect (NO NEED) 
2. Add input: rectangle (NO NEED) 
3. Add angular velocity to rect (NO NEED) 
(we solve the problem like a chad instead)
