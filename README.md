# N_Pendulum_Simulator

## Project description in a nutshell

Our project is an interactive software tool that allows users to interact with a physical system comprised of a pendulum and other simple geometric objects. The interactive tool allows them to configure a pendulum with various options such as the number of objects attached to a pendulum, the weight of each object, the length of the rope attached to the object, etc.

Moreover, they are able to add external objects, namely, circles and squares â€“ to make the system more complex. They are also able to configure those external objects with a number of parameters, i.e., their positions, mass, movability, and whether they will be affected by gravity.
